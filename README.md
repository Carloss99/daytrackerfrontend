Daytracker is a simple easy-to-use website that lets you create tasks for any day of the week. The website will direct you to the current day of the week so that your tasks for the day are displayed just by opening the website. I decided to use django rest framework for my backend for the simplicity of having full CRUD functionality so i can focus more on my frontend. I chose to use react for my frontend because i feel more comfortable creating components and just adding them to the main app component.


technologies used:
-django rest framework
-react 
-tailwind
-postgreSQL
